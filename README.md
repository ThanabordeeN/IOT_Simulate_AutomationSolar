# ☀️ Solar Cell Direction Automation ☀️

This project aims to automate the direction of solar cells in real-time to optimize light absorption. It uses an MCU ESP32 to communicate with a SQL database through MQTT and Node-RED. 

## 🌐 Real-Time Solar Cell Redirection 🌐

The solar cells are programmed to move in real-time according to the direction of the light. This is achieved by using an MCU ESP32, which communicates with a SQL database through MQTT and Node-RED. This ensures that the solar cells are always positioned to receive the maximum amount of light.

## 🕹️ Manual Control 🕹️

In addition to the automated redirection, the solar cells can also be manually controlled. This is done through a standalone program developed using PyQt. This feature allows for greater flexibility and control over the direction of the solar cells.

# 🛠️ Built With 🛠️

* MCU ESP32 - The microcontroller used.
* MQTT - The connectivity protocol used.
* Node-RED - The programming tool for wiring together hardware devices used.
* PyQt - The set of Python bindings for Qt libraries used.
